## Dataset
- Download link in [google drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ngeSyPWOUkj0DTS4M1zuSsbIdYeAHHhS?usp=drive_link) or [Onedrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AsLBo0q3zUjCgYRfYHgM8oSZqFsiFg?e=YfJTuf). The total size is 2.72G    
- Unzip them to a path (e.g., `data`)
- Split dataset into train/val/test set, see the directory `data`
 The specific spliting file is put in `BH_dataset.py`
- Obtain the statistics of the dataset, see the directory  `datasteglobe` 
The specifi file is `stats_dataset_globe.py`    
- Distribution of the dataset (45,000 samples)

## Setup environments
Necessary libraries were put in file `requirements.txt`


## Training & Testing
```commandline
python train.py
```

## Testing on 301 urban centers
- Basic information   
  For large metropolitan areas, the file name is xx_large, while for metropolitan areas, the file name is xx_metro.

- Data and predicted results: see [onedrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AsLBo0q3zUjCgYRfYHgM8oSZqFsiFg?e=YfJTuf)  
The mean and std of each urban center is put in `datasetglobe/urbanarea_meanstd.xls` and the results are put in:
![figure](assets/predicted_results.png)
- Predicting by yourself
  - Download and put the origin data (S1&S2) in the current directory `data/urban/input_data`  
![figure](assets/input_data.png)
  - Prepare xx_grid.shp as the prediction unit
    - Download WSF (world settlement footprint) 2019 at 10-m resolution as the valid built-up areas, see the [official website](https://download.geoservice.dlr.de/WSF2019/)
    - Clip WSF to the extent of each urban center
    - Convert the shapefile of urban centers into rasters
    - Split each urban center into grid with size of 640 x 640 m
    - Select the grid with wsf > 20 pixels

  - Predict all the urban centers
```commandline
python predict_realesanet_feature_globe.py
```
- Results:
    -  Distribution
